### Introduction

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
* _ResiConnect_ is a desktop application used to manage contact details specifically targeted at Resident Assistants (RA)/ Resident Fellows (RF).
* RAs/ RFs have to manage many students and other RAs/ RFs under them. Hence, with an address book to note down all the important information about the students/ other RAs will be helpful for coordinating hall events, emergency situations, etc. 
* While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

### Value Proposition

*ResiConnect* simplifies the management of hall residents and staff for RAs and RFs. It provides a centralized system to:

- Maintain up-to-date information on all hall residents

- Facilitate efficient event planning held in the residence

- Ensure quick access to critical information in cases like emergencies
